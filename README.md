# Restaurant-Review-prediction
Here we classify different restaurant reviews into positive and negative reviews

We assign the negative reviews to "0" and positive reviews to "1"

We apply natural language processing to solve thiis problem

We done it in the following steps:-

1> Importing the dataset
2> Cleaning  the text
3> Creating bag of words model
4> Then we apply different classification models and observed that naive bayes performs the best 

After naive bayes we observed that random forest classification gives second best accuracy 

By applying naive bayes we achived a accuracy of 73%
 
Confusion matrix of naive bayes is as follows:-
